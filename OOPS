//OOPS is significant because in real world , we deal with coding real objects , for example in car manufacturing process coding 
// we use cars as objects and code the instructions , hence Object oriented programming is significant
//Java is pure object oriented programming and hence I prefer java
//object is an attribute of class
//class is a blueprint for objects. many objects can be created under class ?? class Car can have maruthi , honda , hyundai as objects
